Date and Times

These are shortcut placeholders for pre-formatted dates and times. See the Custom Date/Time Formatting section below for more refined formatting placeholders.

#_24HSTARTTIME
    Displays the start time in a 24 hours format (e.g. 16:30).
#_24HENDTIME
    Displays the end time in a 24 hours format (e.g. 18:30).

    Displays the start time in a 12 hours format (e.g. 4:30 PM).
#_12HENDTIME

#_EVENTTIMES
    Displays either a single time, time-span, or "All Day" depending on your event times. Format is taken from your Events Manager settings page.
#_EVENTDATES
    Displays either a single date or a date range depending on your event dates. Format is taken from your Events Manager settings page.

Custom Date/Time Formatting

Events Manager allows extremely flexible date formatting by using PHP date syntax format characters along with placeholders.

# or #@
    Prepend # or #@ before a valid PHP date syntax format character to show start and end date/time information respectively (e.g. #F will show the starting month name like "January", #@h shows the end hour).
#{x} or #@{x}
    You can also create a date format without prepending # to each character by wrapping a valid php date() format in #{} or #@{} (e.g. #_{d/m/Y}). If there is no end date (or is same as start date), the value is not shown. This is useful if you want to show event end dates only on events that are longer than one day, e.g. #j #M #Y #@_{ \u\n\t\i\l j M Y}.
