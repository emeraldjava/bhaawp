Date and Times

These are shortcut placeholders for pre-formatted dates and times. See the Custom Date/Time Formatting section below for more refined formatting placeholders.

#_24HSTARTTIME
Displays the start time in a 24 hours format (e.g. 16:30).
#_24HENDTIME
Displays the end time in a 24 hours format (e.g. 18:30).
#_12HSTARTTIME
Displays the start time in a 12 hours format (e.g. 4:30 PM).
#_12HENDTIME
Displays the end time in a 12 hours format (e.g. 6:30 PM).
#_EVENTTIMES

#_EVENTDATES
Displays either a single date or a date range depending on your event dates. Format is taken from your Events Manager settings page.
Custom Date/Time Formatting

Events Manager allows extremely flexible date formatting by using PHP date syntax format characters along with placeholders.

# or #@
Prepend # or #@ before a valid PHP date syntax format character to show start and end date/time information respectively (e.g. #F will show the starting month name like "January", #@h shows the end hour).
#{x} or #@{x}
You can also create a date format without prepending # to each character by wrapping a valid php date() format in #{} or #@{} (e.g. #_{d/m/Y}). If there is no end date (or is same as start date), the value is not shown. This is useful if you want to show event end dates only on events that are longer than one day, e.g. #j #M #Y #@_{ \u\n\t\i\l j M Y}.

Shows the event image url, if available.

Nesting Conditional Placeholders

It is possible to use conditional placeholders within each other. However, by default Events Manager will only go one level deep, meaning it won’t check conditional placeholders within conditional placeholders. This is due to the extra processing required to acheive such behaviour.

In order to enable further levels of nesting, you need to add a line of PHP to your wp-config.php file:

define('EM_CONDITIONAL_RECURSIONS',2);

The example above will go 2 levels down, meaning you could nest conditional placeholders within another conditional placeholder. If you wanted to nest one inside the nested placeholder, then you need to increase that number to 3.
