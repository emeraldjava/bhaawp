	[14:11:04@~]$ phpunit --version

In my /etc/php.ini file i have

    include_path="."

When i run my phpunit

	[14:18:07@bhaawp]$ phpunit 
	PHP Fatal error:  require_once(): Failed opening required 'PHPUnit/Autoload.php' (include_path='.') in /Users/pauloconnell/projects/bhaawp/wp-phpunit/bootstrap.php on line 7
